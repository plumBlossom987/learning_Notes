1.Feature  
1.1 Deals with continuous quantities  
1.2 Considers effects of approximations  

2.Perspective of science & engineering  
2.1Use scientific computing and computer simulations to understand natural phenomena  
2.2Simulations and algorithms allow to build accessible and cheap virtual prototypes(虚拟原型) of engineering problems: “build-and-test”

3.General Problem-Solving Strategy  
Given $y=f(x)$
3.1typical problems include:  
- Evaluate a function: compute output y for given input x.  
- Solve an equation: find input x that produces given output y.  
- Optimize: find x that yields optimal value of y over given domain  
3.2Specific type of problems and the best approach to solving it depend on whether variables and functions involved are:  
- discrete or continuous.   
- linear or nonlinear.  
- finite or infinite dimensional.   
- purely algebraic or involve derivatives or integrals  
3.3 Replace the di!cult problem by an easier one having same or closely related “solutions”: 
- infinite dimensional → finite dimensional. 
- differential → algebraic. 
- nonlinear → linear. 
- complicated → simple.  
Note:The obtained solution might only approximate the true solution of the original problem.  
Goal in Numerical Analysis: Estimate the accuracy of the obtained approximation and ensure that it suffices.
